# Restaurant Recommendation System
This project provides recommendations for restaurants based on user’s interests and location. The project involves the use of K-Means Clustering to find the best restaurant for the users. This can be best used by people who are new to any place and the methodology can be applied to any location of one's choosing. The project was successfully able to show the restaurants on the map which are clustered based on the cuisine type. Unlike other restaurant recommendation systems which are based on content or collaborative filtering this project shows a real time location of the restaurant as we performed location-based clustering considering user’s preferences along with a few details of the restaurant displayed on the map.
